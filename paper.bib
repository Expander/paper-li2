abstract = {The past decade has seen the development of productive fast electronic digital computers. Significant problems have been solved and significant numerical experiments have been executed. Moreover, as expected, a growing number of important problems have been recorded which are not practicably computable by existing systems. These latter problems have provided the incentive for the present development of several large scale digital computers with the goal of one or two orders of magnitude increase in overall computational speed.},
