abstract = {The dilogarithm function [1-3], defined by Li2(x) = - ∫x0 (1/z) ln (1 - z) dz, (1) occurs in several different applications in physics and engineering, ranging from quantum electrodynamics, to network analysis, to the thermodynamics of ideal ferromagnets, to the structure of polymers. A new function subroutine is developed which computes the dilogarithm function of a real argument to an accuracy of a few parts in 1015. This program was designed to be included in the usual package of library subprograms relied upon by most users. It employs an alternative computational approach to a previously published algorithm [4].},

abstract = {The past decade has seen the development of productive fast electronic digital computers. Significant problems have been solved and significant numerical experiments have been executed. Moreover, as expected, a growing number of important problems have been recorded which are not practicably computable by existing systems. These latter problems have provided the incentive for the present development of several large scale digital computers with the goal of one or two orders of magnitude increase in overall computational speed.},
